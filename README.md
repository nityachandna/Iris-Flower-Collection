# IRIS FLOWER COLLECTION

# AIM
The aim of this project is to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

# DATASET
The dataset used for this project is imported from a CSV file (iris_flower.csv). It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples of each of the three species of iris flower (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica). Each sample contains the lengths and widths of the sepal and petal of the iris flower.

# FILES 
The following files have been created/used for this project:
1. iris_flower.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and the detailed explanation of the project. It covers data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.
2. iris_flower.csv: This is the dataset, in the form of a CSV file, used for the project.
